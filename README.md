## Usage

See [usage guide](https://github.com/nashikinako/XBookmarksOrganizer/blob/main/usage.md).

## Note

- It is too much trouble for the author to check the operation in various environments, so if you were able to check the operation yourself, please post it to [GitHub's issue](https://github.com/nashikinako/XBookmarksOrganizer/issues/1) or [GreasyFork's feedback page](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/496107-x-bookmarks-organizer/feedback).

- It has already been configured to support the X URL change: the script is set to be inserted for both x.com and twitter.com.

## About Donations

This script is provided free of charge, but donations are welcome.

The only method is to purchase gift certificates from Amazon.co.jp, so if you do not live in Japan, it may be difficult to donate, but your donation will help us encourage future development.

If you would like to make a donation, you can do so by purchasing and sending an Amazon.co.jp gift certificate to `nashikinako★outlook.com` (★→@).

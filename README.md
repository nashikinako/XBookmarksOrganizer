## Note

- It is too much trouble for the author to check the operation in various environments, so if you were able to check the operation yourself, please post it to [GitHub's issue](https://github.com/nashikinako/XBookmarksOrganizer/issues/1) or [GreasyFork's feedback page](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/496107-x-bookmarks-organizer/feedback).

- It has already been configured to support the X URL change: the script is set to be inserted for both x.com and twitter.com.
